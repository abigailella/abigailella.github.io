As I approach the end of my undergraduate career, I face not only the great expanse of the “real world”, but also the soon-to-be vacant part of my life that is normally spent writing pages and pages of essays on arcane topics that are of little to no interest to the general public. The real world part is okay, as I’m used to living in it at least most of the time. The stepping-out-of academia bit, though, not so much... 

Because the thought of leaving the academic life makes me be incredibly antsy, I have decided to fill that soon-to-be vacuum with self-imposed essays. I’ll be using this platform to document the following topics:

1.	Adventures in NLP. I’ve recently learned that wiki has a fantastic API. Check up on the next few posts to see some mini-analysis. More built-out projects to come later.
2.	Coding mishaps and triumphs. I’m an English major who fell into the computer world a little late in the game. As I self-teach my way through online classes and books, I’ll do my best to share the highlights.
3.	Library reviews, because instagramming them is not enough anymore. Don’t care about libraries in the way that I care about libraries? Too bad. I will never apologize for this.<sup>*</sup> 
4.	Occasional physics fangirling/travel blogging. It’s been a lifelong dream to tour CERN, and by a fun turn of events, I’ll be spending the summer in the area. If I run into Fabiola, readers of this blog will be some of the first to know. I’ll also be sure to document some of my more captivating travel stories. 

Anyways, first posts are hard, and I have a thesis to finish. I’ll wrap it up here. Cheers! 

<sup>*</sup>Long live #librariesofthenortheast
