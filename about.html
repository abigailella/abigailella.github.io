<p> I work as an editorial assistant at Princeton Press. I'm also pursuing a masters degree in Compiter and Information Science at The University of Pennsylvania.
					When I'm not busy writing and reading, I like to code!</p>
<p>I am also especially interested in libraries: as institutions, as communities, as centers of knowledge,
and as cogs in the university engine.  </p>
