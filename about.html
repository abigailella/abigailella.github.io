<p> I work as an editorial assistant at Princeton Press. I'm also pursuing a Master's degree in Communication and Information Technology at The University of Pennsylvania.
					</p>
<p>I am especially interested in libraries: as institutions, as communities, as centers of knowledge,
and as cogs in the university engine.  </p>
