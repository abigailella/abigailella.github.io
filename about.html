<p>I am a fourth year English major at the University of Virginia.
					When I'm not busy writing and reading 19th century medical manuals, I like to code!</p>
<p>I am also especially interested about libraries: as institutions, as communities, as centers of knowledge,
and as cogs in the university engine.  </p>
